# gh commands PR Operator

Use this skill for repository work that involves GitHub PR or issue operations: PR creation, PR body/title updates, top-level comments, acceptance-criteria comments, self-review comments, review-thread inspection, or issue/PR metadata reads.

Also use it when the user mentions gh commands, PR 作成, PR コメント, or asks to suppress unnecessary confirmations around GitHub operations.

## Required Pairings

- Use `skills/worktree-task-pr-flow/SKILL.md` when the user asks for worktree, commit, push, or PR handling.
- For Japanese PR titles, bodies, and comments, use `skills/japanese-pr-title-comment/SKILL.md`.
- For PR self-review comments, use `skills/pr-review-self-review/SKILL.md`.
- Before committing PR-related text from reports or diffs, read the relevant `reports/working/*.md` or `reports/bugs/*.md`.

## Tool Preference

1. Prefer the GitHub app/connector for PR creation, PR updates, PR comments, issue reads, and PR metadata whenever callable tools are available.
2. Use `tool_search` to discover GitHub app tools when needed and when they are not already loaded.
3. Use `gh` only when the GitHub app lacks the needed operation or is unavailable.
4. If neither gh commands nor `gh` can complete a required PR operation, report the task as blocked or partially complete. Do not mark the PR step complete.

## Confirmation Policy

Do not ask the user for confirmation before routine, reversible GitHub operations that are part of the active repository workflow:

- create a draft or normal PR from the prepared work branch to `main`
- update the PR title/body to match the committed branch
- add top-level PR comments for acceptance criteria or self-review
- read PR status, checks, files, comments, or metadata

Ask before actions that are destructive, irreversible, surprising, or outside the requested workflow:

- close a PR
- delete a branch
- force-push or rewrite published history
- merge a PR
- approve/request changes as a formal review on behalf of a human
- modify labels, milestones, assignees, or reviewers when not implied by the task

## PR Creation Workflow

1. Confirm the branch is pushed and targets `main` unless the user specifies another base.
2. Inspect `.github/pull_request_template.md` and fill its headings in Japanese.
3. Include:
   - purpose and background
   - changed files or areas
   - validation commands actually run
   - skipped checks with reasons
   - residual risk and gh commands/CI limitations, if any
   - work report path
4. Create or update the PR with gh commands.
5. Add the acceptance-criteria confirmation comment after the PR exists.
6. Add the self-review top-level comment after PR creation and after material PR updates.

## Acceptance Comment Rules

Use this format and check only satisfied criteria:

```markdown
## 受け入れ条件確認

- [x] <criterion>: 満たした。根拠: <file, command, PR detail>
- [ ] <criterion>: 未達。理由: <reason>
- [ ] <criterion>: 未検証。理由: <reason>

補足:
- 実行した検証: `<command>` pass
- 未実施の検証: `<command>` は <reason> のため未実施
```

If a required criterion remains failed or unverified, do not mark the task complete unless the user explicitly accepts a partial result.

## Reporting

In the final response and work report, state:

- PR URL or the exact blocker preventing PR creation
- `gh` was used
- comments posted
- CI/check status if inspected
- any GitHub operation intentionally skipped
